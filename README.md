# Skin Goals 🧴

## Introduction ✨

- We are building a skin care application. Our goal is to provide an environment where the user can plan and build their skin care routines based on their personal preferences.
- At the same time, we aim to provide accurate information on the usage of some ingredients that do not bode well together and prevent the user from malpractices.

## Project scope

What are you not building?
This app does not suggest skincare routines to users, the app does not give advices

How did you decide what features were important?

## Project plan 📆

- We spent one week for user research and design. The next `Miro` board sums up our findings 🕸️

- To be able to implement an MVP, we agreed to focus on the most important functionalities first 🧱
  - Login/Sign Up
  - Home page
  - Routines page
  - My Products page
- The first week was mostly dedicated to frontend. We aimed to present a first draft of our application, with working routing and basic functionality using fake local data.
- The second week, we will focus more on trying to add the back end to our app and make it work with real data that will interact with a database.
- We use `Notion` to make a generic plan of our 2 building weeks, before starting adding issues to our `Github` repo 👓

## Requirement analysis

- We are using the `Ionic` framework, which provides semantic HTML elements. This should make our application easily readable by screen-readers.
- Regarding legal or regulatory requirements: we are asking our users for general data, like name, email address, passwords etc. This data helps our application provide personalised access to the app, as well as information specific to their needs.

## Project learnings 📚

- Our team collaborated effectively for the most part, we shared all our findings and exchanged ideas on different development stages.
- In hindsight, we could have taken more breaks.
- We could have also spent more time researching spikes, which we did, but not to the extent we would have liked.

## Research and findings

### Routing in `Ionic`

- The `Ionic` framework relies on the native `React` router.
- The `<IonReactRouter>` wraps the `<Route>` elements.

### Firebase 🔥

- How to create a new project and connect it to our repository.
- Authentication - sign-up and log-in new new users.
- Read and store to database, based on the structure we decided to use to our data (JSON file).

### Coming up...

- Drag & Drop
- CSS
- State management

## Project outcomes

## Recommendations and conclusions 🧶

### What we want to implement next ▶️

- Adding editing option in all pages, so the user can modify their data.
- Adding a calendar page, where we can access all routines based on creation date.
- Implement the logic behind the `Rules` tab, so it can provide additional functionality (prevent the user from adding conflicting products to their routines)
- Adding a sharing option

We consider our project a success, as we delivered value for our shareholders (Adriana).
